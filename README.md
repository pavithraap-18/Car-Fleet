# Car-Fleet
You are given n cars, each with a starting position and a speed. All cars are moving towards a common target location on the same straight road.

However, cars cannot overtake each other. If a faster car catches up to a slower car ahead, it will slow down and form a fleet, arriving at the destination at the same time as the slower car.

Your task is to determine how many distinct car fleets will arrive at the destination.
